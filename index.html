    <p class="w3-justify">Adam was formed out of the dust of the earth like the beasts of the earth. 
        God breathed life in him. He came forth by the breath of life. When Adam 
        sinned, his life was in the blood. Resurrected Jesus came as flesh and bone. 
        Jesus shed his blood. He gave his blood that man could inherit everlasting 
        and eternal life. Death was gone. He died so we won't have to die. The blood 
        of Christ destroyed the curse. As long as we are flesh and blood, we shall 
        die.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">It’s the end of Satan because we become spirit beings (that is, in the glorified state); that fight his forces in such power that he has no chance.  He can’t even 
      attack you with sickness when you come into that place.  Everything is different, although we might look the same.  We become completely enveloped in Christ.  We become one with Christ 
      and one with the Father.  It’s a birth of the Spirit.  We come into it by absolute obedience to God. The flesh is the proving ground to bring the spirit into subjection.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 Corinthians 15:19-26</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most 
        miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that 
        slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in 
        Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the 
        firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall 
        have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and 
        all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last 
        enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</strong></p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 Corinthians 15:28</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also

        of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not 
        all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: 
        for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</strong></p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 8:2-8</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law

        That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the 
        Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the 
        Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is
        life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of 
        God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</strong></p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">2 Corinthians 5:1-8</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we 
        have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we 
        groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: If so be that 
        being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being 
        burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be 
        swallowed up of life. Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath 
        given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst 
        we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: (For we walk by faith, not by
